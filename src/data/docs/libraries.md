# Unison Share

Unison Share is at the heart of the Unison ecosystem. It is where developers
publish their projects and share their code. Code and documentation hosted
there is completely browsable. Click from one definition to the next by
clicking symbols in the code, share definitions, or share whole projects.

Checkout the [base
library](https://share.unison-lang.org/latest/namespaces/unison/base), and many
other libraries on [Unison Share](https://share.unison-lang.org).

Get your library on Unison Share by following this [guide](https://github.com/unisonweb/share#adding-projects-to-unison-share).

There's active discussion of new library work in the [`#libraries` channel on Slack](/slack).
